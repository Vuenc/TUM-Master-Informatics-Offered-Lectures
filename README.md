# TUM Informatics, DEA: Offered Lectures

This repo aims to provide a **list of lectures** that are being offered this semester grouped by area of specialization for various TUM CIT degree progams:

- **Informatics bachelor**:
  - List of lectures [offered in winter semester 2025/26](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/bachelor-informatics-ws25-26.html)
  - [List of all courses and when last offered](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/bachelor-informatics-all.html)
- **Informatics master**:
  - List of lectures [offered in winter semester 2025/26](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/master-informatics-ws25-26.html)
  - [List of all courses and when last offered](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/master-informatics-all.html)
- **DEA master**:
  - List of lectures [offered in winter semester 2025/26](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/dea-ws25-26.html)
  - [List of all courses and when last offered](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/dea-all.html)
- **Information Systems master**:
  - List of lectures [offered in winter semester 2025/26](https://vuenc.github.io/TUM-Master-Informatics-Offered-Lectures/master-information-systems-ws25-26.html)

_This list is not official, might be incomplete or have errors. Use with care!_

This information is crucial for students at the start of every semester, who need to choose lectures in the right areas of specialization to conform to the program's rules. However to my knowledge no user-friendly overview is provided by TUM at the moment: There is a list of all currently offered lectures, with no quick way to see the area of specialization, and a separate, clunky curriculum tree view that shows all lectures ever offered in the curriculum.

I created this repo for my own use as a MSc Informatics student and open-sourced it, and now continue to maintain it. **If you want a similar list for other study programs, I'm happy to collaborate! Just open an issue and we can have a look. The scripts should be easy to generalize to other study programs.**

The list is generated by scraping data from the TUM online curriculum tree view (all lectures sorted by area) and merging it with the data from the TUM online courses tabs (all lectures currently offered).

If you find a mistake, like a lecture missing, you can create an issue.

If you find the list is out of date because some information changed in TUM online, you can recreate the table by running the scripts:

1. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```sh
virtualenv .fetchcourses-env
source .fetchcourses-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Regenerate all tables using the provided script: This takes a couple of minutes and regenerates the tables for all curriculums. If the semester has changed, you need to update the TERMID and TERMNAME variables in the script. (TUM online identifies semesters by term ids: for example, 199 is winter term 2023/24, 200 is summer term 2024. For reasons unknown to me, term ids 201 and 202 are skipped, and winter term 2024/25 has term id 203.)

```sh
cd src/
sh regenerate-all.sh
```

3. (alternatively:) Regenerate individual curriculum tables manually.

- Fetch the offered courses from TUM online (update the --termid argument accordingly).

```sh
cd src/
python update_course_database.py --termid 204 --oldtermsfrom 171 --curriculum master-informatics
```

- Fetch the curriculum tree data (update the --curriculum argument accordingly, see `src/curriculums.py` for the supported options.)

```sh
python fetch_curriculum_tree.py --parallel_drivers 5 --curriculum master-informatics
```

- Generate the HTML file with the table (update the --curriculum, --termid and --output arguments accordingly)

```sh
python print_html_table.py --termid 204 --curriculum master-informatics --output "../docs/informatics-ss25.html"
python print_html_table.py --termid 204 --curriculum master-informatics --oldtermsfrom 171 --output ../docs/informatics-all.html
```
